# Financial Statement Fraud Detection  

## Abstract  

Financial statement fraud poses significant risks to businesses, investors, and regulators. This project aims to develop an effective machine learning framework to detect fraudulent financial reporting. Using a dataset containing financial variables and pre-determined financial ratios, we explore multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and RUSBoost.  

Our approach leverages 28 financial variables and 14 financial ratios to train models with fraud and non-fraud labels. Performance evaluation is conducted using metrics such as AUC, NDCG@k, sensitivity, and precision. Random Forest and XGBoost demonstrate superior sensitivity and precision, outperforming RUSBoost. We also compare our results with standard evaluation techniques and existing research findings.  

Future work will integrate Large Language Models (LLaMA3, GPT-4o) to analyze Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) text, earnings call speech tones, and facial data for improved fraud detection. This research contributes to advancing fraud detection techniques and enhancing financial transparency.
